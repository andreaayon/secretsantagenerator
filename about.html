        <h3>About Me</h3>
        <p>My name is Andrea Ayon. I am a third year computer science major at the University of Georgia.</p>
        <p>I have a passion for front-end development/web development and I love exploring and getting creative with coding.</p>
        <p>I decided to do this project for my family since we do a yearly secret santa gift giving tradition.</p>
        <p>I dedicate this project to my family who has always helped and supported me along the way!</p>
