            <h1>About Me</h1>
            <p>My name is Andrea Ayon, and I am a third-year Computer Science major at the University of Georgia.</p>
            <p>I have a strong passion for front-end and web development, and am always eager to explore creative ways to bring my ideas to life through coding.</p>
            <p>This project is especially meaningful to me, as it celebrates my family's tradition of Secret Santa gift-giving, which we enjoy every year.</p>
            <p>I dedicate this project to my wonderful family, who have been my greatest supporters and have always encouraged me on my journey!</p>
